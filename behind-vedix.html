        <p class="lead">Understanding Hair Issues According To Ayurveda:</p>
        <p>To understand the significance of a simple hair issue on a magnified scope, understanding any hair issue
            from the Ayurvedic perspective is essential.</p>
        <p>Ayurveda looks at hair issues on a micro level and hence, gets to the root of the issue instead of
            “band-aid” treatment. </p>
        <p>This is also one of the reasons why Ayurveda chooses one of the most easily understandable methods to
            measure the magnitude of the hair issue, the root cause, and the solution, with just a simple assessment.
            At Vedix, we call this method as the “Dosha Assessment”*, wherein we analyse the elevated states of Vata
            (Air and Ether Energies), Pitta (Fire Energy) and Kapha (Water and Earth Energies) in an individual through
            the inputs given in the Dosha Assessment Questionnaire*

            <li>
                <p><b>What Causes Hair Fall?</b></p>
                <p>According to Ayurveda, several reasons can cause for the hair on your scalp to weaken and fall off.
                    Some of these reasons include, exposure to dust, pollution, inconsistent diet, water contamination,
                    usage of too many hair products, unsafe methods of styling, disturbed sleep cycles and much more.
                    All of these can contribute to the disturbance of doshas and their elevation, which causes Hair
                    Fall.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Doshas And Their Influence On Hair Fall</b></p>
                <p>When doshas are elevated, they create diseases in areas, which they regulate, moderate, and control.
                    Scalp being one of the regulating areas, cannot withstand the elevated state and this causes an
                    abnormal environment for the hair follicles.</p>
                <p><b>Vata Dosha When Elevated: </b></p>
                <p>Elevated Vata Dosha can lead to dehydrated scalp, hair fall, thinning of hair, dry scalp, dandruff,
                    cracked scalp surface and more. </p>
                <p><b>Pitta Dosha When Elevated:</b></p>
                <p>Elevated Pitta dosha can lead to loss of hair caused by greasiness, overheat, scalp inflammation,
                    weaker roots, dandruff, inflammatory diseases on the scalp, and more.</p>
                <p><b>Kapha Dosha When Elevated:</b></p>
                <p>Elevated Kapha dosha can lead to excess oil production on the scalp, greasy scalp, itching, greasy
                    dandruff, hair fall and more.</p>
                <p>This elevation weakens the follicle gradually and causes the hair strand to fall off and the
                    follicle to close off in the long run.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Pacifying The Elevated Doshas</b></p>
                <p>Vedix can help you treat hair fall caused by the elevated doshas with herbs, which help in
                    specifically pacifying the elevated doshas. The herbs not only pacify the elevated doshas, but also
                    nourish hair and scalp, saving your follicles from further damage and arresting the hair fall
                    caused by elevated doshas, altogether.</p>

                <p><b>What Causes Dandruff?</b></p>
                <p>According to Ayurveda, several factors can cause your scalp to be flakey. Some of these reasons include, excess oil production, lack of moisture on scalp, insufficient nutrient supply to the scalp, exposure to dust, pollution, inconsistent diet, water contamination, usage of too many hair products, unsafe methods of styling, disturbed sleep cycles and much more.

                <p><b>Doshas And Their Influence On Dandruff</b></p>
                <p>When doshas are elevated, they create diseases in areas, which they regulate, moderate, and control. Scalp being one of the regulating areas, cannot withstand the elevated state and this causes an abnormal environment for the scalp bed.</p>

        <h2>The Physiology Of Hair Growth Cycle:</h2>
        <p class="lead"><b>Board Certified Dermatologist</b></p>
        <p><b>Anagen phase</b> of a hair growth cycle is the phase where the hair follicle is in a <b>“growth-mode”</b>. The Custom Vedix Regimen will include </b>herbs, which can specifically help in prolonging the Anagen phase</b>, which results in hair growth promotion, whilst also treating the root cause of the hair fall, i.e, elevated doshas.</p>
        <p class="lead"><b>For Dandruff:</b></p>
        <p><b>Telogen state</b> of a hair growth cycle is the phase, where the hair follicle is at rest. This becomes an <b>ideal state for the bacteria on the scalp, such as Dandruff, to attack the healthy areas of the scalp and contaminating the scalp</b>. The Vedix Custom Anti-Dandruff Vedix Regimen will include <b>herbs, which can specifically help in arresting the active dandruff</b> that exploits the telogen phase of the hair follicle. The herbs also help in treating the root cause of the dandruff, i.e, elevated doshas.</p>
