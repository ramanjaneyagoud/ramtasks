<body>
    <button class="accordion">How is Vedix any different from other Ayurvedic hair care brands? <span class="plus"></span></button>
    <div class="panel">
        <p>Unlike other brands that give generic solutions, Vedix is a customized hair care solution. We customize the
            products according to one’s elevated doshas and Prakruti (inherent body constitution).</p>
    </div>
    <button class="accordion">Why do I need to take the shampoo?<span class="plus"></span></button>
    <div class="panel">
        <p>Generic shampoos have surfactants which can be harsh on your scalp. Using generic shampoo while you’re
            following a custom box will only disturb your scalp health further. Our team of Ayurvedic doctors suggest
            using custom shampoo provided in your custom box to avoid side-effects from the use of other generic
            products.</p>
    </div>
    <button class="accordion">Can I buy the products individually? <span class="plus"></span></button>
    <div class="panel">
        <p>As the custom products - oil, shampoo, and serum are interdependent, you cannot buy the products
            individually. We suggest using all 3 products to gain maximum benefits.</p>
    </div>
    <button class="accordion">Do the products work for premature greying too? <span class="plus"></span></button>
    <div class="panel">
        <p>Our products do help reduce greying to some extent but not completely.</p>
    </div>
    <button class="accordion">Why do I need a customized regimen? <span class="plus"></span></button>
    <div class="panel">
        <p>Your scalp and hair type are unique to only you. Generic products are made for everyone. When products are
            made for everyone, they are not made for you and your hair. This is why our team of Ayurvedic doctors
            researched for a simple regimen that can be customized according to one’s doshas and their elevated states.</p>
    </div>
    <button class="accordion">Will the products make my hair fall off? <span class="plus"></span></button>
    <div class="panel">
        <p>As the products are customized according to your hair and your body’s Prakruti, the products having an
            effect of hair fall is rare. The products are meant to arrest the hair issue and help regrow your hair.</p>
    </div>
    <button class="accordion">Do the products have any side-effects? <span class="plus"></span></button>
    <div class="panel">
        <p>As the products are customized for your particular hair type, the chances of the products having an
            adverse-effect is quite rare. Our products use 100% natural ingredients and hence, that further reduces the
            risk of any side-effect. However, some people can be allergic to natural products, but the chances of
            side-effects are comparatively less when compared to synthetic counterparts.
        </p>
    </div>
    <button class="accordion">If I stop using the products in between, will I have any side-effects? <span class="plus"></span></button>
    <div class="panel">
        <p>The products take time to actually penetrate your follicles and start arresting the hair issue. If you stop
            using the products abruptly, there won’t be any hair issues. However, if you get back to using other
            generic products before you complete your regimen, you might experience hair fall.</p>
    </div>
    <button class="accordion">What if I don’t see results? Will the products surely work? <span class="plus"></span></button>
    <div class="panel">
        <p>Our products do not give instant results. They give results that last long. Your patience will be worth it.
            Just keep using the products as instructed and you will see results gradually.</p>
    </div>
    <button class="accordion">What If i use these products irregularly (missed using a step or two)? <span class="plus"></span></button>
    <div class="panel">
        <p>To get the maximum benefits from your products, use the products as instructed. Try your best to not miss
            out on the steps mentioned for your regimen.</p>
    </div>
    <button class="accordion">Can I buy these products somewhere else like Amazon or retail Stores? <span class="plus"></span></button>
    <div class="panel">
        <p>Since our products are customized for you according to your Prakruti, our products cannot be bought from
            online-shopping platforms like Amazon. You can head over to www.vedix.com and place your order.</p>
    </div>
    <button class="accordion">What exactly is customization? <span class="plus"></span></button>
    <div class="panel">
        <p>Vedix takes in the inputs one gives through the Vedix Dosha Assessment Questionnaire. This helps us define
            the elevated states of your doshas, based on which, we recommend products. The recommended products have
            herbs that can help pacify the elevated doshas, which helps in treating the hair concern.</p>
    </div>
    <button class="accordion">What is Prakruti? <span class="plus"></span></button>
    <div class="panel">
        <p>Prakruti is your body’s inherent constitution. It’s everything that your body is made of. Each element of
            your body is part of Prakruti. Blood, Muscle, Bones, Digestive Fire, Glands, Lymphs, Veins, Mental
            characteristics etc help determine your body constitution. This is your Prakruti. Your Prakruti is unique
            to only you.</p>
    </div>
    <button class="accordion"> How to know what my doshas are? <span class="plus"></span></button>
    <div class="panel">
        <p>Once you take our verified Prakruti Questionnaire, you will be able to understand what exactly your doshas
            are and which dosha is more dominant in your Prakruti.</p>
    </div>
    <button class="accordion">How accurate is this Dosha Assessment Questionnaire? <span class="plus"></span></button>
    <div class="panel">
        <p>The questionnaire has been prepared and verified by certified Ayurvedic doctors, which adds to the accuracy
            of our questionnaire.</p>
    </div>
    <button class="accordion">Can I use this analysis for my real life health concerns? <span class="plus"></span></button>
    <div class="panel">
        <p>our questionnaire is accurate with regards to define a hair care solution for you according to your
            Prakruti. It is still suggested to get a real-life Prakruti analysis and consultation for other serious
            health problems.</p>
    </div>
    <button class="accordion">I experience a lot of hair fall, oiliness, itchiness, acne on the scalp, dandruff, scalp
        flaking, etc on my scalp. What can I do? <span class="plus"></span></button>
    <div class="panel">
        <p>You can always start with taking Vedix’s Prakruti questionnaire and understand what is causing your hair to
            react the way it is. Our analysis will help you better understand your hair, issues, and the solution!</p>
    </div>
    <button class="accordion">19. Why am I paying even before I take the questionnaire? <span class="plus"></span></button>
    <div class="panel">
        <p>The products that will be given to you go through a 3-step verification process, which involves actual
            manual work. None of the processes are automated or computerized.

            <p><b> Step 1:</b> We make a report of your doshas and their elevated states and send over the same to our
                Ayurvedic doctors. </p>
            <p><b>Step 2:</b> Our team of Ayurvedic doctors look into your case thoroughly and add in a combined
                mixture of distilled herb extracts, which enhance the quality and the efficacy of your custom products.
                This also ensures that your products suit your particular hair type, issue, and Prakruti. </p>
            <p><b>Step 3:</b> The products are then labeled according to your Prakruti, doshas, and ingredients used
                for your custom box.</p>
            <p>Since the products are customized only for your specific issue, hair type, and Prakruti, no one else can
                use these products. </p>
