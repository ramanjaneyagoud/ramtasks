        <h2>Why Vedix</h2>
        <p>Vedix is India’s only customized ayurvedic hair care regimen. At Vedix, we strongly believe in taking
            ayurveda back to its original roots. Thus, every product begins with a thorough examination of your body
            and its humors. </p>
        <p>We went back and studied the Tridosha Theory to pinpoint the root causes of hair issues like Hair Fall and
            Dandruff, in detail. This helped us understand that there is an ideal approach towards hair issues and it
            is so accurate that we incorporated the same into our Unique Dosha Assessment Questionnaire* (A simple
            online questionnaire to understand the root cause of your hair issues).</p>
        <p>The ideal approach is not generic. It is all about customization.</p>
        <p>The ideal approach is to understand the root cause of the issue and pacify the factors that are elevating
            the issue. That is exactly what you get at Vedix.</p>
        <p>If you are one of the millions of people, who uses a generic hair product that is made for millions of
            people out there, then there is something that you need to know before it’s too late. It’s the fact that
            the products are made for everyone else out there but, not for your unique needs, is doing more bad than
            good. The benefits you render from generic products... seldom last.</p>
        <p>This creates an urgency for people who have serious hair issues to take their hair issues not only
            seriously, but deal with them smartly. Like how we do at Vedix. </p>
        <p>It all starts with customization.</p>

        <h2>How Customization Works?</h2>
        <p>Contrary to the regular hair regimens available out there, the focus shifts from the product to you. <b>Customization
                Starts With You</b>. Vedix customizes the products according to the inputs given by you in our Vedix
            Dosha Assessment Questionnaire*. This questionnaire asks fundamental questions about your health,
            lifestyle, preferences and more to map your doshas and their elevated states. </p>
        <p class="lead"> Customizing Products According To The Elevated States Of Doshas:</p>
        <p> Vedix customizes the products based on the elevated states of <b>Vata</b> (Energy of Air and Ether), <b>Pitta</b>
            (Energy
            of Fire) and <b>Kapha</b> (Energies of Water and Earth) in an individual. Depending upon the inputs given
            by one,
            Vedix meticulously analyses and formulates a unique solution, which is suitable for that particular
            individual. </p>

        <h2>Unique Distillation Process*:</h2>
        <p>Every single minute granule of the herb undergoes a unique process, which separates the useful and the useless parts of the herb. Vedix uses this useful part of the herb and distills them individually to attain a nutrient-rich compound. When each individual herb undergoes such a unique distillation process, the efficacy of the compound mixture increases. When a herb undergoes a unique process like this one, it helps boost absorbability of the herb by the scalp and follicles. This, in turn, gives one hassle-free lustrous hair.</p>
